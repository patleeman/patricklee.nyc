Finally got my [dotfiles](https://github.com/patleeman/dotfiles) set up. Now I can have a consistent environment across both Mac and Linux. Really only using it for managing initial environment setup scripts and to manage my terminal environment. Will continue to evolve it as I need to but glad to have built out the basic scaffolding.
