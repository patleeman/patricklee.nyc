Taking a page from [Wes Bos' `/uses`](https://wesbos.com/uses) page.

## Software

- For writing code:
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which has great notebook support.
  - Neovim via [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/)
  - Jetbrains IDEA (for Java)
- My favorite Font: [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)
- Current Terminal: [WezTerm](https://github.com/wez/wezterm)
- [My Dotfiles repo](https://github.com/patleeman/dotfiles) repo. 
- [In Your Face](https://www.inyourface.app/) is an app I couldn't live without. It blocks your screen when you have a meeting with a big modal. I haven't missed or been late to a meeting since I got it.
- [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) for reviewing commits
- Tmux
- Arc Browser
- For Calendar & Email I use [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com/).

## Hardware

- My desk is a [L-Shaped Standing Desk from Uplift Desk](https://www.upliftdesk.com/)
- I sit on a [Herman Miller Aeron](https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/office-chairs/aeron-chairs/) I got off craigslist for cheap.
- My "monitor" is a [48" LG C1 OLED TV](https://www.lg.com/us/tvs/lg-oled48c1pub-oled-4k-tv) with a 5 year warranty from Best Buy that covers pixel burn-in. I fell in love with OLEDs when I got one for my living room. Its a big screen at 48", but I run it at 4K and from where I sit, the DPI is quite comfortable. I just have a huge wall of screen to use which is great.
  - I have four devices connected to that all share a common set of peripherals via a USB switch:
    - My work laptop
    - My personal laptop
    - Gaming PC
    - Playstation 5 / Steam Deck
- My keyboard is a [Ultimate Hacking Keyboard v1](https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/) that I crowdfunded in 2015 and received in 2018. I've been using this keyboard close to 6 years now and its the best mechanical keyboard I've ever used.
- I use a Glorious Model O mouse, its nice and lightweight for gaming.
- Apple Airpod Max Headphones
