```
Oh my dearest linter,
adding squiggly lines under my mistake.
Gently teaching me why I'm wrong.
How do I fix it?
Some help would be nice.
You autocorrected it! Thank you twice!

The documentation is right at hand:
"you idiot, don't add an ampersand!"
But I think you might be wrong,
my dear linter this is an edge case!
Well then I'll just have to add
a little comment to disable that
tiny check on line 35.
I'm sorry my linter,
you'll have to abide.

```
