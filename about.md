# About

I'm a software engineer, engineering manager, and team leader with experience building and scaling Growth teams. Helping companies scale is incredibly satisfying to me and I've found that Growth teams are where I can best apply my skills. I'm a huge proponent of being a [grug brained](https://grugbrain.dev/), [product-minded software engineer](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-product-minded-engineer/). Complexity demon bad.

I'm a productivity geek and love knowledge management systems. Most of my time is spent figuring out how to be more productive (therefore making myself less productive). I started a small company called [Collate Notes](https://github.com/Collateapp/CollateNotes) that sold a note taking app for a while. I also created an open source note taking Visual Studio Extension called [VSNotes](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=patricklee.vsnotes). These days I'm a big fan of [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/).

I took a pretty non-traditional path to where I'm at today. I dropped out of college, helped open a paintball field, and worked as a paralegal. I went back to school later on, first starting at [community college and completing my bachelors in Economics-Mathematics at Columbia University](/blog/from-community-college-to-columbia/). When I left school, I became a data analyst. I soon discovered I was not a fan of Excel or cleaning data. I got into software development while learning Python for data analysis and got into web development.
