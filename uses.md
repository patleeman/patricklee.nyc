![My desk setup](/public/blog/setup.png)

I'm a fan of [Wes Bos' `/uses`](https://wesbos.com/uses) page. Who doesn't love showing off their battle station?

## Development Tools

- I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my text editor.
- [Wes Bos' Cobalt 2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wesbos.theme-cobalt2) theme is hands-down my favorite theme for everything.
- [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) is my go-to editor font with ligatures enabled.
- I typically use VSCode's built in terminal when developing. However, when I need a dedicated terminal, I use the Mac's built in Terminal with a Cobalt2 flavored [theme](https://github.com/patleeman/dotfiles/blob/master/manual/terminal/cobalt2.terminal). I used to use iTerm2 but realized that a styled Terminal.app is more than enough for my needs.
- I use [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) on Macs with a pretty [generic config](https://github.com/patleeman/dotfiles/blob/master/configs/ohmyzsh.zsh).
- On linux I use [bash-it](https://github.com/Bash-it/bash-it) with a pretty [generic config](https://github.com/patleeman/dotfiles/blob/master/configs/bash_it.bash) as well.
- I manage all my dotfiles and new machine setup scripts in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/patleeman/dotfiles/tree/master/configs) repo.

## Apps

- I love [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) for note-taking and task management.
- [In Your Face](https://www.inyourface.app/) is an app I couldn't live without. It blocks your screen when you have a meeting with a big modal. I haven't missed or been late to a meeting since I got it.
- [Fork](https://git-fork.com/) is my favorite Git GUI. I has an intuitive and simple design and is **fast**.
- For browsing, I use Firefox on my personal machines and both Firefox and Chrome on my work machine.
- I use Dropbox for file storage after de-googling my life.
- For Calendar & Email I use [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com/).
- [1 Password](https://1password.com/) for password management.

## Desk Setup

- My desk is a [L-Shaped Standing Desk from Uplift Desk](https://www.upliftdesk.com/)
- I sit on a [Herman Miller Aeron](https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/office-chairs/aeron-chairs/) I got off craigslist for cheap.

- I have four devices connected to my "monitor" that all share a common set of peripherals via a USB switch:

  - My work laptop (M1 Max Macbook Pro)
  - My personal Mac Mini (M1 256)
  - My Gaming PC
  - Playstation 5

- My "monitor" is a [48" LG C1 OLED TV](https://www.lg.com/us/tvs/lg-oled48c1pub-oled-4k-tv) with a 5 year warranty from Best Buy that covers pixel burn-in. I fell in love with OLEDs when I got one for my living room. Its a big screen at 48", but I run it at 4K and from where I sit, the DPI is quite comfortable. I just have a huge wall of screen to use which is great.
- My keyboard is a [Ultimate Hacking Keyboard v1](https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/) that I crowdfunded in 2015 and received in 2018. I've been using this keyboard close to 5 years now and its the best mechanical keyboard I've ever used.
- I use a [Glorious Model D](https://www.gloriousgaming.com/products/glorious-model-d-matte-black) mouse, its nice and lightweight for gaming.
- I also use a [Apple Magic Trackpad](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK2D3AM/A/magic-trackpad-white-multi-touch-surface) which sits between the two halves of my keyboard for when I don't want to move my hands a lot.
- I use [Bose 700](https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/noise_cancelling_headphones/noise-cancelling-headphones-700.html#v=noise_cancelling_headphones_700_black) headphones, but I would not recommend them. They have a tendency to flop off my head if I look up. Terrible design.
- Also on my desk are an iPad Pro, Steam Deck and Oculus Quest 2.
