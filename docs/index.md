# About

I currently work at Noom as a Tech Lead Manager of the Growth Experimentation team. I am helping to build a team and tools that focus on creating and running experiments extremely quickly.

I am fascinated with digital information organization systems. Previously, I owned a small company that sold a note taking app called [Collate Notes](https://github.com/Collateapp/CollateNotes). I also created an open source note taking Visual Studio Extension called [VSNotes](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=patricklee.vsnotes).

I have a non-traditional background. I dropped out of college and then went back in my late twenties. I went to community college and moved on to complete my bachelors degree at Columbia University. From there I went into data analytics where I fell in love with software development.

My interests outside software include cooking, BBQ, powerlifting, and around the house DIY projects.
