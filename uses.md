![My desk setup](/public/blog/setup.png)

I'm a fan of [Wes Bos' `/uses`](https://wesbos.com/uses) page. Who doesn't love showing off their battle station?

## Development Tools

- I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my text editor.
- [Wes Bos' Cobalt 2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wesbos.theme-cobalt2) theme is hands-down my favorite theme for everything.
- [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) is my go-to editor font with ligatures enabled.
- I manage all my dotfiles and new machine setup scripts in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/patleeman/dotfiles) repo.
- I've recently switched to [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) as my main editor and IDE. I'm using [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) as a base, and have [customized it](https://github.com/patleeman/dotfiles/tree/master/home/nvim) to suit my preferences. I'm now using [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) to manage terminal sessions and [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/) as my terminal.
- I use [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) on Mac with a pretty [generic config](https://github.com/patleeman/dotfiles/blob/master/configs/ohmyzsh.zsh).

## Apps

- I love [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) for note-taking and task management, however I'm currently learning vim, so I'm managing my note files manually for now.
- [In Your Face](https://www.inyourface.app/) is an app I couldn't live without. It blocks your screen when you have a meeting with a big modal. I haven't missed or been late to a meeting since I got it.
- [Fork](https://git-fork.com/) is my favorite Git GUI. I has an intuitive and simple design and is **fast**.
- For browsing, I use Firefox on my personal machines and both Firefox and Chrome on my work machine.
- I use Dropbox for file storage after de-googling my life (as much as possible).
- For Calendar & Email I use [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com/).
- [1 Password](https://1password.com/) for password management.
- [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) is a new spotlight replacement I've been playing with. Its very similar to [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) but more modern.

## Desk Setup

- My desk is a [L-Shaped Standing Desk from Uplift Desk](https://www.upliftdesk.com/)
- I sit on a [Herman Miller Aeron](https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/office-chairs/aeron-chairs/) I got off craigslist for cheap.

- I have four devices connected to my "monitor" that all share a common set of peripherals via a USB switch:

  - My work laptop (M1 Max Macbook Pro)
  - My personal Mac Mini (M1 256)
  - My Gaming PC
  - Playstation 5

- My "monitor" is a [48" LG C1 OLED TV](https://www.lg.com/us/tvs/lg-oled48c1pub-oled-4k-tv) with a 5 year warranty from Best Buy that covers pixel burn-in. I fell in love with OLEDs when I got one for my living room. Its a big screen at 48", but I run it at 4K and from where I sit, the DPI is quite comfortable. I just have a huge wall of screen to use which is great.
- My keyboard is a [Ultimate Hacking Keyboard v1](https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/) that I crowdfunded in 2015 and received in 2018. I've been using this keyboard close to 5 years now and its the best mechanical keyboard I've ever used.
- I use a [Glorious Model D](https://www.gloriousgaming.com/products/glorious-model-d-matte-black) mouse, its nice and lightweight for gaming.
- I also use a [Apple Magic Trackpad](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK2D3AM/A/magic-trackpad-white-multi-touch-surface) which sits between the two halves of my keyboard for when I don't want to move my hands a lot.
- I use [Bose 700](https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/noise_cancelling_headphones/noise-cancelling-headphones-700.html#v=noise_cancelling_headphones_700_black) headphones, but I would not recommend them. They have a tendency to flop off my head if I look up. Terrible design.
- Also on my desk are an iPad Pro, Steam Deck and Oculus Quest 2.
