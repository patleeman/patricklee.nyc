# Hello!

I probably sent you this because we will be working together! Thanks for stopping by! This is my [personal user manual](https://friday.app/p/personal-user-manual-for-work) and I appreciate you taking time out of your day to take a look!

Let's dive right in!

## One fun fact about me

I went to 4 different high schools and ended up graduating from the [New York Military Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Military_Academy).

## What gives me energy at work

- Working with motivated people towards a goal
- Having agency and trust from my peers and managers
- Helping to get a product into the hands of people
- Helping my coworkers be successful

## What drains me at work

- Context switching and constantly shifting priorities
- Loss of agency
- When expectations aren't clearly communicated with me
- When bureaucracy prevents me from doing my job 

## Preferred communication channels/style

- Synchronous calls when needed
- Asynchronous docs as much as possible when collaborating on a project
- Slack for quick chats, banter, or if you want to just send me messages
- I'm not a big fan of email

## How can someone earn a gold star with me

- Inexplicably I love [Saturn Devouring His Son memes](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/saturn-devouring-his-son). I'm attempting to collect prints of my favorite ones. If you find a funny one, send it to me!
- Capybaras are my spirit animal, especially [pictures of random other animals standing on Capybaras](https://www.reddit.com/r/Crittersoncapybaras/).

## How I like to receive feedback

I believe feedback as a gift. I'm happy to receive feedback in whatever way you're most comfortable giving it to me. I understand giving feedback can be really hard!

I do ask when you do give me feedback to provide an example if possible, how it made you feel, and how I could do better. This helps me understand the impact of my behavior and address it appropriately.

## Things people might misunderstand about me

I'm passionate about the teams I'm on and I want to improve them. I also try to be as transparent as possible and provide feedback to improve the teams I'm on. Sometimes I'll call things out and provide feedback for things I think we can improve. I just want to help make our team better! If this is rubbing you the wrong way though, please do let me know!

## Honest, unfiltered things about me

- I'm a self taught developer and although I've been doing the job for 8+ years, I still feel imposter syndrome!
- My CS fundamentals probably aren't as strong as somebody that has a BS in Comp Sci. I'm working on it, albeit slowly!
- I do however have a Bachelors of Economics-Mathematics from Columbia.
- I don't have a lot of strong opinions about technology and will err on the side of simple, boring, and battle tested.
- I consider myself an entrepreneur first and a developer second. Building products for real human beings is my priority, not building the most perfect software. I understand the benefits of building high quality software, but will always put creating user value first.
- I really love Growth because it is user facing, requires you to think like an owner, and is as close to starting your own startup inside a company as you can get.

# The End

That's the end! If you have a similar doc to this that you'd like to share with me, please send it over! I'd really appreciate any information you'd be comfortable sharing to make working with you easier and more productive!
